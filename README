Keyword-Level Demographics Project v0.1.9.12
Code by Michael King - mike@ipullrank.com
with contributions by Joshua Giardino - jsgiardino@yahoo.com

The following code was developed to pull search referrers and Facebook data 
and push it to Google Analytics. The code is meant to be a proof of concept
for how keyword-level demographics can be devised by combining two readily
available data sources.

The application of this methodology is thoroughly discussed in Michael King's
SMX East 2011 presentation "The Past Present and Future of Personas in Search."
Michael King also goes on to explain the methodology in an SEOMoz post at

The Keyword-Level Demographics project is on-going at "The Best Practice" blog
